# 📄 Resume Classification  

### 📝 Overview  
This project is a **Resume Classification System** designed to categorize resumes into various professional domains such as **Data Science**, **Web Development**, **Marketing**, and more. By leveraging machine learning and natural language processing (NLP), it automates the tedious process of resume screening, saving time and improving accuracy for recruiters.

---

### 🎯 Objectives  
- Automate resume categorization for recruitment efficiency.  
- Enhance candidate filtering by identifying domain-specific resumes.  
- Minimize manual intervention in resume screening.  

---

### ⚙️ Technologies Used  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Machine Learning Frameworks**:  
  - Scikit-learn  
  - XGBoost  
  - Random Forest  
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**:  
  - NLTK  
  - spaCy  
  - Transformers (BERT, GPT-based models)  
- **Text Vectorization**: TF-IDF, CountVectorizer  
- **Data Handling**: Pandas, NumPy  
- **Visualization Tools**: Matplotlib, Seaborn  

---

### 🚀 Features  
1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Text tokenization, lemmatization, and stop-word removal.  
   - Noise removal for clean and usable text data.  

2. **Feature Extraction**  
   - Extracts meaningful information using TF-IDF and n-grams.  

3. **Resume Classification**  
   - Uses supervised learning models for multi-class classification.  

4. **Performance Metrics**  
   - Evaluates the model using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  

---

### 📂 Dataset  
- A curated dataset of resumes labeled with respective domains.  
- Contains structured and unstructured resume samples.  
- Dataset is stored in the `data/` directory.  

---

### 📊 Results  
- **Accuracy**: Achieved up to **92%** on test data.  
- **Domain Insights**: Improved classification for domains with unique skillsets like Data Science and Web Development.
